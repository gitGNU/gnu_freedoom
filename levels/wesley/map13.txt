INFO:
Level is large,
  secrets: 4
  sectors: 1099
  linedefs: 4017
  wad size: 695K

  If it has to get smaller then I would have to cut
  the elevator, or the curved stairs.

  There are still some places where the corner of a
  building gets clipped, but they have been reduced to
  the point where it is not worth it any more.


PLAY:
  Non-linear, freestyle.
  Can attack in at least 3 different ways (5 for experts), by different routes,
  by running wild, sneaking around, or careful planning.
  Many monsters roam free and will be encountered unexpectedly.
  Watch your back. I have got shot in the back so
  many times I am getting paranoid.


Play hints for map13:
They are not asleep and will come when they hear you.
Avoid shooting in open areas until you are prepared for the big fight.
Locate the ammo and health reserves, and be prepared to retreat to them.
Use the machinery, you do not have to shoot them all.  But you have to get
to it while you can.
Choose your attack route and if it proves difficult switch to another.
There is more than one way into any area, use them all.
Choose several areas that can be defended, you will need them.
Too many flaming heads to fight in the open, they will be everywhere.
Monsters wander about, areas do not stay cleared.
More will arrive, usually from behind you.
Watch your back, frequently.
There are three ways to get out of secret lab, 1) be quick,
2) hot-wire the door, 3) climb to alternate exit.
Understanding the war-game theory of interior lines of communication
will be your advantage.
